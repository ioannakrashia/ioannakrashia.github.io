                            <p>Nicosia (Lefkosia) is the capital city of Cyprus, and some would say its very heart and soul. If you have limited time to see Cyprus, then Nicosia should be at the top of your list. Steeped in historic and archeoligical sites, the old city is surrounded by a complete circular wall built by the Venetians between 1567 and 1570, the periphery of which is about 3 miles. The wall has three gates (Paphos Gate, Famagusta Gate and Kyrenia Gate (in Turkish occupied area), as well as eleven heartshaped symmetric bastions. The Famagusta Gate with its two halls and passageway, has become Nicosia's Cultural Center and well worth visiting. The Paphos Gate is a controlled entrance point to the buffer zone, manned by the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>The narrow streets of the old city make it a unique and fascinating place to look around. Other places are well worth visiting are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>The Cyprus Handicraft Center</b> on Athalassa Avenue, where you can watch traditional art skills and handicraft being made, as well as buy traditional Cypriot products.</li>
                                <li><b>TThe Municipal Arts Center</b> on Apostolou Varnava Street, which was the Old Electricity Generating Plant, and is now a center for contemporary art.</li>
                                <li><b>The Leventis Municipal Museum</b> on Hyppocratous Street in Laiki Yitonia, next to Eleftheria Square, which houses exhibits dating from before 2000 BC up to the present day.</li>
                                <li><b>TThe Cyprus Museum</b> on Museum Street, said to be the richest and best archaeological museum in Cyprus, showing treasures of art from the Neolithic Period (5800 BC) to the early Byzantine Period (330-1192AD), including Cypriot pottery, terracotta, clay and stone sculptures, bronze and jewellery.</li>
                                <li><b>The Byzantine Art Museum</b> is housed within The Archbichopric (The Archbishop's palace), and displays the largest collection of Cyprus icons, with 220 pieces that cover the periods from the 5th to the 19th century.</li>
                                <li><b>Cyprus Jewellers Museum</b> on Praxippou Street, Laiki Yitonia, where traditional jewellery from the end of the 19th century are on display.</li>
                                <li><b>The Cyprus Postal Museum</b> on Agiou Savva street, where you will find a stamp collection that is internationally acknowledged for having some of the best and most significant stamps in the world, as well as a rare collection of pre-war designed post boxes, an automatic stamping machine, pre-war scales, and medals.</li>
                                <li><b>The Museum of The History Of Cyprus Coinage,</b> which is on the on the ground floor of the Bank of Cyprus Headquarters, where you will find a beautiful display of chronologically arranged coins from the 6th century B.C. to the present day.
Ledra Museum Observatory, housed on the 11th floor of the Shakolas building on Ledra Street, where you can take in 360 degree panoramic views of the whole of Nicosia town.</li>
                                <li><b>The Municipal Gardens</b> are a very green and scenic place to relax and unwind.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Of course no visit to Nicosia would be complete without a shopping trip, and there is plenty on offer both in the Old City, as well as the new town along Arch Makarios Avenue.</p>
                                <p>The places listed above are just a very few of the many interesting things to see in Nicosia. Stop off at a Cyprus Tourist Information Center for much more information.</p></div>

                                        <p>Despite being the capital city and our hometown, it is probably not the ideal destination during summer time as it will be warmer than other cities and quite far from the beach. We would recommend that you come to Nicosia only for the wedding ceremony. If you are spending more days in Cyprus, you can plan a day trip (or an evening trip when the temperature is lower).

                                <p>Limassol (Lemesos), until medieval times it was known as Nemesos, meaning 'in between' due to its position in between the two ancient cityies of Kourion and Amathus. This is a perfect place for anyone looking for a relaxing beach holiday combined with some historic sight seeing. Beaches in Limassol include - Ladies Mile Beach - Curium Beach - Pissouri Beach - Governor's Beach - Ayios Tychonas Beach, and many of them provide water sports such as wind surfing, paragliding, and scuba diving.

Kourion is said to be one of the most important ancient city-kingdoms in Cyprus. Set high upon the cliffs, the remains include relics from the 5th century BC, including the House of Eustolios, originally a private Roman villa featuring baths and numerous rooms, and the Early Christian basilica, believed to have been the Cathedral of Kourion. The House of Achilles and the House of the Gladiators with its intricate mosaic floors, and the Nymphaeum, a Roman structure dedicated to water nymphs. There is also a fully restored Greco-Roman Theatre, originally built in the 2nd century BC, and which is now used for musical and theatrical performances, and is quite spectacular.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Sanctuary of Apollon Ylatis</b> is located just 2.5km west of ancient kourion. Excavations at this important sanctuary have revealed structures such as the bath complex, the pilgrim halls, the palaistra and a holy precinct.</li>
                                    <li><b>Limassol Folk Art Museum</b> is situated on St. Andrews Street in Limassol's old town. Here you will find a good collection of national costumes, tapestry and embroidery exhibited in a restored house.</li>
                                    <li><b>Panagias Vounarkotissa</b>, located in Kolossi, this is a little church built inside a cave.

                                <p>Areas that we recommend you visit are the Germasogeia dam, a calm and scenic area that is a favorite of local anglers. From autumn through Spring the Salt Lake of Akrotiri is a lovely spot to visit to see the migratory birds that stop-over. Also the famous wine regions of Omodos andCommandaria should not be missed, where not only will you enjoy the unspoilt scenery, but also many of the wine making companies have free wine tasting available.</p>

                                        <p>This is where the International Airport is located and where our wedding venue will be. Larnaca is around 40 mins from Nicosia and 30 mins from Ayia Napa and Limassol. A stay here is recommended if you are prefer to spend the night of the wedding somewhere close to the venue, or if your flight leaves the next day of the wedding. We would generally recommend not to spend your full holiday in Larnaca as there are much nicer cities to visit.</p> </div>

                                <p>Paphos is appreciated for its really good hotels and its nature. Akamas forest which is close to Paphos serves for safaris but also boat trips to crystal clear waters (highly recommended!). Should you decide for a trip to Paphos we will provide you with more information.
